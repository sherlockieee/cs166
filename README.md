# cs166 - Modelling Complex System

Fun things to explore:
- Final project is a model of a waste modeling system, analyzing the effectiveness of the travelling salesman problem's approximation function using different heuristics versus the greedy algorithm approach in a system with constraints. 
- Assignment 1 is an object-oriented model of a bus scheduling system, analyzing how number of buses influences waiting time, queue length and carrying capacity under queueing theory models. 
- LBA is a simulation of a traffic intersection calculating the average traffic flow and average speed of cars on the road based on different car density, and using mean-field approximation to do theoretical analysis as a base point of comparison.

For all projects, I would suggest read the report accompanied first to understand the overall simulation and code structure, use the notebook as needed.

Everything was fun. I freaking love this class.
